# customRNN
Tensorflow provides high level functions to easily build neural networks. Sometimes we need to derive the network gradients and implement backpropagation manually to adopt networks for specific tasks. I have implemented a recurrent neural network with low level tensorflow-2.0 functions. 

The regression loss history for the testing case is given:
